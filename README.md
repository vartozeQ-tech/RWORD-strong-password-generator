But why would I use it?
-As you know, coming up with a password that is hard to crack can be difficult, which is why this program was created (you can also be sure that passwords are not being sent somewhere because the program is open source)

Where should I keep these passwords? I can't remember them!
-There are password managers for something. you can use the ones built in your browser (I don't recommend it) or you can use a good and well known solution which is keepass, keepass is a free local password manager which is additionally encrypted which makes your passwords safe, keepass is available both for android and for windows/linux and in addition it is open source

[keepassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)

So now there is nothing left but to download and start using, you can use the compiled application in the relase tab or compile it yourself in visual studio (or other compiler)
